# Resizing VMWare root Drive with Ubuntu without reinstalling or damaging the boot volume

In this video I will demonstrate how to resize your root volume of Ubuntu that is running inside VMWare without damaging the root boot grub install. This technique requires a Ubuntu or Linux .iso file to work. This is more complicated than it appears as you can not modify a root volume while it is mounted in VMware and you can't modify it with a swap drive mounted.
