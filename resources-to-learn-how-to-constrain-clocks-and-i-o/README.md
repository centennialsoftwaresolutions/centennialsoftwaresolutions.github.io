# Resources to Learn How to Constrain Clocks and I/O

![intel_logo_1](intel_logo_1.jpg)

This post lists some resources that I found that have helped me learn about setting clock and I/O constraints.

**<u><span>Resources</span></u>**

The following present how to use Timing Analyzer + static timing analysis concepts like **slack, input delay** and **output delay**. They also provide a good overview of setting timing and I/O constraints:

-   Part 1: Timing Analyzer: Introduction to Timing Analysis \[[<u><span>link</span></u>](https://youtu.be/B73G4BuTpLo)\]
    
-   Part 2: Timing Analyzer: Timing Analyzer GUI \[[<u><span>link</span></u>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGAwgI3Fs-k)\]
    
-   Part 3: Timing Analyzer: Intel Quartus Prime Integration & Reporting \[[<u><span>link</span></u>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7mMYhuQIbY)\]
    
-   Part 4: Timing Analyzer: Required SDC Constraints \[[<u><span>link</span></u>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfaiPxl9Z9A)\]
    

I have pulled out posts that show each slide and list the transcripts at these four links:

-   Timing Analysis Concepts & Terminology \[[<u><span>link</span></u>](https://www.centennialsoftwaresolutions.com/blog/timing-analysis-concepts-terminology)\] (part 1)
    
-   Fast & Slow Corners in Timing Analysis, Steps to Run Timing \[[<u><span>link</span></u>](https://www.centennialsoftwaresolutions.com/blog/timing-analyzer)\] (part 2)
    
-   Run Timing on a Cheaper Speed Grade to Save Money \[[<u><span>link</span></u>](https://www.centennialsoftwaresolutions.com/blog/run-timing_on_a_cheaper_speed_grade_to_save_money)\] (part 3)
    
-   SDC Design Constraint Examples and Explanations \[[<u><span>link</span></u>](https://www.centennialsoftwaresolutions.com/blog/sdc-design-constraint-examples-and-explanations)\] (part 4)
    

In addition, Intel has these great courses that are free:

-   Constraining Double Data Rate Source Synchronous Interfaces (ODDR1000) \[[<u><span>link</span></u>](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/support/training/course/oddr1000.html)\] \[[<u><span>course</span></u>](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/customertraining/webex/DDR/presentation_html5.html)\]
