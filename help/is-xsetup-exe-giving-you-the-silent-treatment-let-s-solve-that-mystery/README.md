# Is "xsetup.exe" Giving You the Silent Treatment? Let's Solve That Mystery! ðŸ˜±

![xilinx_logo_1](xilinx_logo_1.png)

Ever clicked on 'xsetup.exe' only to be met with... silence? You're not alone. In fact, there's a sneaky culprit behind this that's tripped up many Windows users. If the phrase "space in your user name" rings a bell, then I've got a revelation for you. For those of you using Windows 10 (or earlier versions) with Vivado 2022.1 and prior, this post might just save you a headache or two!

Quick Hint: Itâ€™s all about those .bat scripts and how they deal with spaces. But don't worry, I've got the remedy you're looking for. Dive in to find out!

You'll need to do three separate steps

First look at xic.bat and xsetup.bat:

```
$ grep -REns USERPROFILE *
xic.bat:10:set ARGS=%ARGS% -DLOG_FILE_NAME=%USERPROFILE%/.Xilinx\xinstall\xic.log
xic.bat:11:set ARGS=%ARGS% -DLOG_FILE=%USERPROFILE%\.Xilinx\xinstall\xic.log
xsetup.bat:59:  set LOG_FILE=%USERPROFILE%\.Xilinx\xinstall\xinstall-%logName%.log
xsetup.bat:61:  if not exist "%USERPROFILE%\.Xilinx\xinstall\" (
xsetup.bat:62:          mkdir %USERPROFILE%\.Xilinx\xinstall
```

Next, change the scripts to (just add quotes):

```
$ grep -REns USERPROFILE *
xic.bat:10:set ARGS=%ARGS% -DLOG_FILE_NAME="%USERPROFILE%/.Xilinx\xinstall\xic.log"
xic.bat:11:set ARGS=%ARGS% -DLOG_FILE="%USERPROFILE%\.Xilinx\xinstall\xic.log"
xsetup.bat:59:  set LOG_FILE="%USERPROFILE%\.Xilinx\xinstall\xinstall-%logName%.log"
xsetup.bat:61:  if not exist "%USERPROFILE%\.Xilinx\xinstall\" (
xsetup.bat:62:          mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\.Xilinx\xinstall"
```

Now, if you try to run xsetup.exe it'll error with **File: bin\\xsetup.bar is tampered!** seen here:

Work around this by right-clicking on xsetup.bat and selecting **Run as Administrator**:

Incidentally, when you're installing, make sure you install for **All users** - you can't go back and fix this.

That's it. Happy installing!

## You will see the same silent behavior when you click Add Design Tools or Devices 2022.1:

To fix this, right-click and **Open file location**

![open_file_location_6](open_file_location_6.png)

Then right-click and click **Properties**:

See where this shortcut lives:

Then make the quoting change to the installed **bin\\xsetup.bat** and **bin\\xic.bat** and run **bin\\xsetup.bat** as **Administrator** as above.

Finally, if you click on Vivado on the desktop and you have a space in your username you may run into two errors when you attempt to export a platform or bitstream:

```

If you look at the log you'll see that the username space has caused issues (my username is **Zach Pfeffer**):
