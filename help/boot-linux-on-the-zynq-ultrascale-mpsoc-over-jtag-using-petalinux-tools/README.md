# Boot Linux on the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC over JTAG using PetaLinux Tools

![xilinx_logo_1](xilinx_logo_1.png)

This post describes how to boot Linux on the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC with XSCT 2017.4 over JTAG. It presents a script that has been modified from the default script that PetaLinux Tools 2017.4 uses. I modified the default script because I could not use the default script more than once, i.e. it worked the first time, but when I ran the default script again, it caused the system to hang.

The post overlays the write up on boot from the PS Boot and Device Configuration section of the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Data Sheet @ [link](http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds891-zynq-ultrascale-plus-overview.pdf) with the XSCT instructions used to help set the context of the instructions.

These instructions worked with PetaLinux Tools 2017.4 and XSCT 2017.4.


**Boot Info**

Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs use a multi-stage boot process that supports both a non-secure and a secure boot.

The **PS** is the master of the boot and configuration process.

For a secure boot,

the AES-GCM, SHA-3/384 decrypts and authenticates the images

while the 4096-bit RSA block authenticates the image.

**Boot Flow (steps from doc are bolded)**

**1\. Upon reset, the device mode pins are read to determine the primary boot device to be used: NAND, Quad-SPI, SD, eMMC, or JTAG.**

**JTAG can only be used as a non-secure boot source and is intended for debugging purposes.**

Script

The script forces a reset and disables JTAG security with:

![disables_jtag_security_2](disables_jtag_security_2.gif)

```
puts -nonewline "Reseting"

targets -set -nocase -filter {name =~ "*PSU*"}
stop
rst -system
after 2000

targets -set -nocase -filter {name =~ "*PMU*"}
stop
rst -system
after 2000

targets -set -nocase -filter {name =~ "*PSU*"}
stop
rst -system
after 2000

mwr 0xFFCA0038 0x1ff

targets -set -nocase -filter {name =~ "*MicroBlaze PMU*"}
dow "pmufw.elf"
after 2000
con
```

Script Explanation

The "**targets**" line selects the PSU or PMU.

"**stop**" suspends execution of the active target.

"**rst**" resets the active "**system**."

Note: I don't know and cannot find the exact definitions of what happens when you "stop" and "rst -system." This sequence was figured out by experiment.

**mwr 0xFFCA0038 0x1ff**

This ^^^ disables the PMU MDM, PLTAP and ARM DAP security gates. It allows:

-   the PS TAP to connect to the PMU,
    
-   the PSTAP to connect to the PL for bitstream loading and boundary scan operations and
    
-   the PS TAP or PJTAG to connect to the DAP
    

Acronyms

-   **PMU MDM stands for the Platform Management Unit Microprocessor Debug Module**
    
-   **PLTAP stands for the Programmable Logic Test Access Point**
    
-   **ARM DAP stands for the ARM Debug Access Port which provides access to ARM CoreSightâ„¢ components.**
    
-   **PS TAP stands for the Processor Subsystem Test Access Point**
    
-   **PJTAG stands for Processor JTAG**
    
-   **Note on PSJTAG and PJTAG From the Technical Reference Manual:**
    
-   **There are two JTAG port interfaces: PSJTAG and PJTAG**
    
-   **The PSJTAG port can reach all TAP controllers on the chain.**
    
-   **The PJTAG interface port provides exclusive access to the ARM DAP controller.**
    

After resetting the PSU and PMU, we select the PMU and download PMUFW. Because dow doesn't take any info, I assume that it reads the ELF. Here's an example:

```
p:$ ./build/tmp/sysroots/x86_64-linux/usr/bin/aarch64-xilinx-linux/aarch64-xilinx-linux-readelf -l ~/build/out/pmufw.elf 

Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)
Entry point 0xffdc8abc
There are 2 program headers, starting at offset 52

Program Headers:

```

**dow** will load the PMUFW to 0xffdc0000 and set the PC to 0xffdc8abc. The **con** will release the PMU at 0xffdc8abc.

0xffdc0000 is the starting address the 128 KB PMU RAM (FFDC\_0000 + 1\_FFFF = FFDD\_FFFF last address)

**2\. The CSU executes code out of on-chip ROM and copies the first stage boot loader (FSBL) from the boot device to the OCM.**

**3\. After copying the FSBL to OCM, one of the processors, either the Cortex-A53 or Cortex-R5, executes the FSBL.**

**Xilinx supplies example FSBLs or users can create their own.**

Script

```
targets -set -nocase -filter {name =~ "*APU*"}

dow "zynqmp_fsbl.elf"
after 2000
con

after 4000; stop; catch {stop}; psu_ps_pl_isolation_removal; psu_ps_pl_reset_config
```

Script Explanation

Select the APU.

Write 0x14000000 to 0xFFFF0000. 0xFFFF0000 is the start of the 3rd OCM memory bank. 0x14000000 is \_need to figure this out\_

Write 0x501 to 0xFD1A0104. 0xFD1A0104 is the **Software Controlled APU MPCore Resets (RST\_FPD\_APU)**. The bits are defined as:

![software_controlled_apu_mpcore_resets_bits_are_defined_as_3](software_controlled_apu_mpcore_resets_bits_are_defined_as_3.png)

0x501 sets APU core0 into system reset (bit 0), APU L2 into reset (bit 8) and APU core0 POR reset. (I don't know why the other bits are not set).

Wait 2 seconds, then **remove** the core0 reset, the L2 reset and the POR reset reset.

Select core 0 of the APU.

Source psu\_init.tcl. The psu\_init.tcl is automatically generated from your hardware design. It does around 500 writes to various addresses based on your configuration. Here's a list of the high-level settings that psu\_init.tcl does:

After psu\_init the fsbl is loaded to 0xFFFC\_0000 (OCM Memory Bank 0) and PC is set to 0xfffc0000:

```

![ocm_mapping_summary_4](ocm_mapping_summary_4.png)

FSBL executes for 2 seconds (-time to download). After the download

**psu\_ps\_pl\_isolation\_removal** is called (from psu\_init.tcl)

This function just sends a PL power up request to the PMU in the script that was generated in my design.

and

**psu\_ps\_pl\_reset\_config** is called (from psu\_init.tcl)

This function doesn't look like it does anything in the script that was generated in my design.

At the end of this stage the FSBL is running on core 0 of the A53 out of OCM. In addition the DDR has been set up.

**4\. The FSBL initiates the boot of the PS and can load and configure the PL, or configuration of the PL can be deferred to a later stage.**

**The FSBL typically loads either a user application or an optional second stage boot loader (SSBL), such as U-Boot.**

**Users obtain example SSBL from Xilinx or a third party, or they can create their own SSBL.**

**5\. The SSBL continues the boot process by loading code from any of the primary boot devices or from other sources such as USB, Ethernet, etc.**

**If the FSBL did not configure the PL, the SSBL can do so, or again, the configuration can be deferred to a later stage.**

**The static memory interface controller (NAND, eMMC, or Quad-SPI) is configured using default settings.**

**To improve device configuration speed, these settings can be modified by information provided in the boot image header.**

**The ROM boot image is not user readable or callable after boot.**

Script

```
targets -set -nocase -filter {name =~ "*A53*#0"}
dow -data "Image" 0x00080000

targets -set -nocase -filter {name =~ "*A53*#0"}

targets -set -nocase -filter {name =~ "*A53*#0"}
puts stderr "INFO: Downloading ELF file to the target."

after 2000
con
```

Script Explanation

Recall that the FSBL is running on core 0 of the A53.

The Linux kernel binary "Image" is loaded at 0x0008000.

Then the device tree binary is loaded to 0x1407f000.

After this a little "mini" boot loader called linux-boot.elf gets loaded @ 0x80000000:

```
p:~/plprjs5/mtd_board$ ./build/tmp/sysroots/x86_64-linux/usr/bin/aarch64-xilinx-linux/aarch64-xilinx-linux-readelf -l ~/build/out/linux-boot.elf

```

This little stub jumps to the Image load address after storing the address of the device tree blob into 0x1407f000.

Finally, Arm Trusted Firmware (bl31) is loaded at 0xfffe0000 and the A53 core 0 PC is set to 0xfffea000. This is memory bank 2 of the OCM. Core 0 of the A53 is then continued. This executes Arm Trusted Firmware which starts the kernel loaded at 0x8000000.

**PMU I/O Block Registers** from page 131 of the Zynq UltraScale+ Device **Technical Reference Manual:**

_PMU I/O Block Registers_

_The PMU I/O block registers include all the registers associated with the interrupts,_ _GPI/GPO, and the programmable interval timers (PITs). There are two PMU processor I/O_ _modules. The first module includes the interrupt controller, GPI/GPO \[0-3\], and PIT0-PIT3._ _The second I/O module includes a GPO2 interface (only). The base address for the I/O_ _modules \[0\] and \[1\] are shown in Table 6-5._

![pmu_memory_map_7](pmu_memory_map_7.png)

_PMU Global Registers_

_The global register file includes registers that are used as a means of communication_ _between the PMU and other blocks to synchronize activities regarding power/system_ _management and reset._ _The PMU global register file is mapped at address FFD8 0000â€”FFDB FFFF. For a bit-level_ _description, refer to the PMU\_GLOBAL section in the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Register_ _Reference (UG1087) \[Ref 4\]._

_PMU GPIs and GPOs_

_The PMU processor includes four local (only accessible by the PMU processor) GPI banks_ _and four GPO banks. GPI0 and GPO0 are reserved for the dedicated PMU processor_ _subsystem features (see PMU Processor), while GPI3 and GPO3 are reserved for_ _communication with the PL. GPI1, GPI2, GPO1, and GPO2 are used for communication_ _between the PS hardware features and the PMU._ _The PMUâ€™s general-purpose I/O features include miscellaneous wake, errors, and_ _handshaking signals. The usage of the GPIs and GPOs can be summarized as follows with all_ _signals being active-High unless otherwise specified._ _â€¢ GPI0 is used internally by the PMU processor. GPI0\[31:0\] shows the value of the_ _fault-tolerance status register._ _â€¢ GPI1 monitors wake-up requests. Table 6-6 describes the various GPI1 bit(s)._

_â€¢ GPI2 monitors power control requests. Table 6-7 describes the various GPI2 bit(s)._

_â€¢ GPI3 monitors the GPIs from the PL._

_â€¢ GPO0 is dedicated to the PMU features. Table 6-8 describes the various GPO0 bit(s)._

_â€¢ GPO1 is dedicated to the GPOs assigned to the MIO for signaling and power-supply management. Table 6-9 describes the various GPO1 bit(s)._

_â€¢ GPO2 is dedicated to the PMU-generated requests and acknowledges. Table 6-10_ _describes the various GPO2 bit(s)._

_â€¢ GPO3 is dedicated to the GPOs to the PL._
