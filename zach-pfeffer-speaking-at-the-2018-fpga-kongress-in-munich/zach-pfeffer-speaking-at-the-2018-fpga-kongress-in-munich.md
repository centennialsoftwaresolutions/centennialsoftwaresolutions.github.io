Zach Pfeffer will speak at the upcoming [FPGA-Kongress](http://www.fpga-kongress.de/) Jun 12th - 14th 2018 at the [Hotel NH MÃ¼nchen Ost Conference Center](http://www.nh-hotels.com/hotel/nh-muenchen-ost-conference-center?gmb=new).

He'll be giving two talks:

**Effective Linux development using PetaLinux Tools**

June 12th @ 9:00 AM

PetaLinux Tools provides a great way to work with processors on Xilinx FPGAs. This talk will walkthrough some common workflows and share some tips-and-tricks for you to get the most out of the tool.

**Beyond printk: efficient Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Linux debugging and development**

June 14th @ 9:00 AM

A talk that shows how to efficiently develop on and debug the Linux kernel running on the cores of A53 of the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC. The talk focuses on methods beyond 'printk' including OS debug with the SDK, advanced use of PetaLinux Tools and more...

_Note: this talk now focuses primarily on debugging the Linux kernel over a serial port because I couldn't get the SDK to load symbols._
