This post is a quick review of LockHunter, "a free tool to delete files blocked by something you do not know."

**What other programs perform this job?**

I reviewed lists of "Unlockers" at \[[link](http://www.raymond.cc/blog/lockhunter-is-unlocker-alternative-that-works-on-windows-x64/)\] and looked at FileASSASSIN at \[[link](http://emcosoftware.com/unlock-it)\] and UnLock IT at \[[link](http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/fileassassin.htm-0)\].

**Why did you choose LockHunter?**

I liked that LockHunter move deleted files to the Recycle Bin.

**Is this program a virus or does it contain a virus?**

I downloaded lockhuntersetup\_3-3-4.exe and scanned it with McAfee AntiVirus on Dec 23rd 2019. McAfee reported no issues.
