This post links to an article about running Doom on Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC.

###### The Article's First Paragraph

When the System Software team at Xilinx® and DornerWorks initiated the Xen Project hypervisor on Xilinx's Zynq® Ultrascale+™ MPSoC, it was discovered that the system could run the popular 1993 video game Doom as a method of demonstrating and testing the system. The choice of this visually striking game allowed the team to delve into Xen engineering topics, with the intention of imparting knowledge and experience to those who will use hypervisors in the future.

To facilitate this, our team employed an emulation model of the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC that is available for QEMU (the open-source Quick Emulator), setting up the software necessary for the Doom demonstration. This approach significantly reduced the setup time, enabling the system to be brought online in hours instead of days upon the arrival of the silicon.

Before diving into the specifics of how to run Doom on Xen using QEMU on the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC, it is important to first understand the basics of what hypervisors are and how they function in relation to the processors within the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC.
