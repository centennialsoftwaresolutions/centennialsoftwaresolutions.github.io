This post shows how to remove sharing from all your Google Drive files. Its a bit of a workaround, but its better than doing it manually.

Step 1:

In the search-bar type: owner:me before:2019-12-31 after:2019-01-01

Note: the dates allow only a subset of files to be displayed at a time.

Step 2: Click the first result

Step 3: Type Ctrl-a

Important Note 1: you may need to scroll down to see all the files

Important Note 2: it may take a log time or hang Google Drive to select them like this

Important Note 3: you can also hold down Ctrl and click each file with the **shared icon**; the files do not need to be listed contiguously

You should see all the results selected:

Note: I tried to just use **owner:me** and press Ctrl-a but my browser hung.
