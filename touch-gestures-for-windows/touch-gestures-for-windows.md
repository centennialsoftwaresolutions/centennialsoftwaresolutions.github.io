I have created a copy of the content at https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/touch-gestures-for-windows-a9d28305-4818-a5df-4e2b-e5590f850741 to preserve this information for myself and others. This resource provides valuable information on touch gestures for Windows, and I believe it is important to keep it available for future reference.
