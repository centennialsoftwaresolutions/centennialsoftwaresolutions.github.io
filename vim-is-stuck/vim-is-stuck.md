# Vim is Stuck!

![computer_image](computer_image.png)

This post lists Control-q which may un-stuck Vim. It also lists some history about the problem.

Try **Control + q**

If this worked, you pressed Control + s in a **terminal emulator** like GNOME Terminal.

In a terminal Control + s stops terminal output. Control + q restarts it.
