# A Dummies Guide to Ultra96-V2 Initial Setup (No License Key Required)

![xilinx_logo_1](xilinx_logo_1.png)

This guide is meant to supplement the excellent "Ultra96-V2 Hardware and Tools Initial Setup" blog entry by Brian Davis, which will be referred to as "Brians's Guide (BG)." The big difference seems to be in the license setup, which doesn't seem to be required with the method I will be describing. Only the Windows install will be described.
